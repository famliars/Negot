# Negot
The Service Worker Content Negotiation Engine

**Negot** will be a lean, focused library for **Service Workers** that handles **MIME-type-driven content negotiation**. It enables dynamic response generation within the browser's "edge" environment, acting as a crucial component for client-side serverless applications.

### **Core Principles**

  * **Minimalism:** Negot does one thing and does it well: resolves responses based on MIME types.
  * **Non-Intrusive:** It doesn't dictate your Service Worker's routing, caching, or lifecycle management. It's a pure utility.
  * **Highly Extensible:** Negot provides a solid foundation that integrates seamlessly with any Service Worker pattern or library you choose.
